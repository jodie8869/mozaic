# Mozaic.js

**Mozaic** is a jQuery based JavaScript library for transforming a picture into a photomosaic of small thumbnail images.

The underlying data structure used to find the closest tile image is a kd-tree with k=3. This library is adapted from the [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://wiki.engr.illinois.edu/display/cs225/MP+6) class at [the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://www.illinois.edu).
